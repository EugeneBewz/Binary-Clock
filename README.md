# GreenPAK_BinClock
_A hopeless attempt to make a binary clock using Renesas' GreenPAK processor and GreenPAK Designer_

The main idea of this project is to create a binary clock using a GreenPAK processor. Its main goal is to help students comprehend the binary counting system with a real-life example.
For demonstration purposes, we will utilise the **GreenPAK SLG46620G**, and the "script" of the processor will be organised via **GreenPAK Designer** â€” a special software designed by "Renesas". The script is stored in the `NBitCounter_GreenPAK.gp4` file.

Current project status: **How the f*ck does it work?! Where to start?!**

# How it should work
Although I have no idea how it works inside the processor, the theoretical part is simple (as expected).
Every time we send a signal to the processor, after some actions (which I still have to find out), the LED-s are activated in some specific order, representing digits in binary format:

0 - 0
1 - 1
2 - 10
3 - 11
4 - 100
5 - 101, and so on

Below, you can see the expected outcome. (all LEDs were activated by hand; the "code" still doesn't work.)
